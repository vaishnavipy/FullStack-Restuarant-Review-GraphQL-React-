# Restuarant Review app built with GraphQL + React

To build our full-stack app, I've used the below technologies.

- **React**:  Front-end framework, with component based architecture
- **GraphQL**: For data fetching and management realtime
- **Hasura**: Set up an auto-generated GraphQL API on top of a Postgres database.
- **Heroku**: To host our database.
- **Apollo Client** : Client for our GrapQL API , which ,makes fetching data easier with its hooks.


 

# Technology  used:
- Use Subscription Hook for realtime customer reviews
- UseQuery : to query the GraphQL API and update the todo's in our app real-time
- UseMutation Hool : To add,update or delete data from the database and update it in the cache in realtime
- GraphQL query parser
- ApolloClient for fetching data from the GraphQL server
- GraphiQL IDE for buiding the queries
- Heroku : Setup todo table and required columns for our database
